gyp.vim
=======

This is a vim bundle for working with
[gyp](http://code.google.com/p/gyp/) files.

I just wanted some basic syntax highlighting while working with gyp
files.  I don't at all claim to be an expert with vim plugins, so please
feel free to fork and improve.

The main project site is at: [http://github.com/kelan/gyp.vim](http://github.com/kelan/gyp.vim)

Features
--------

I started with the
[vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) syntax
file, cleaned it up a bit, and added some gyp-specific keywords.


Example
-------

Here is a screenshot of it running in
[MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) (specifically, it's alloy's
[file-browser fork](https://github.com/alloy/macvim)), using the awesome
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme.

Installation
------------

If you use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), add the following to
your .vimrc:

    Bundle 'kelan/gyp.vim'

Then launch vim and do `:BundleInstall`.
